_From the Pamir mountains flow five rivers. As they meet in the Tajik region of Panjrud, they give birth to the great Amu Darya, the mother of rivers in Central Asia. Panj means five in Persian, rud means river or instrument._

Based upon the musical encounters of the French accordionist Adrien Seguy on the Silk Road, PANJRUD ENSEMBLE is a new ensemble formed by Solmaz Badri (Iran), Sadriddin Gulov (Uzbekistan), Tigran Davtyan (Armenia), Adrien Seguy (France) and Samuel Wornom (France/USA).

Five musicians at the heart of a new ensemble, channeling their sensibilities to weave together musical traditions of the Silk Road.
